                    As you add hot liquids, the binary for "HOT" appears (read
                    from left to right in one line, not two:

                Welcome
            </h1>

            <p>
                Numbers make up
                <span class="special">everything</span> in our digital world.
                They flow around us, invisible like the Force or the Matrix,
                controlling all our many computer-y devices. Two numbers, in
                particular: <span class="special">0 and 1</span>.
                <span class="b i">Off and On</span>. Well, we can tell you this:
                when there's no coffee in our cup, we're completely OFF our
                game. But when our mug is full of hot coffee, we're totally ON.
                And now, with the
                <span class="keyword">Hot Binary Heat Changing Mug</span>,
                there's a mug that tells us which state our mug is in. In
                binary!
            </p>

            <p>
                See, the
                <span class="keyword">Hot Binary Heat Changing Mug</span>
                looks like just a dark mug with binary numbers all over it.
                That's its OFF or cold state. Add hot coffee (or any liquid) and
                a series of digits will turn white. Read them continuously from
                left to right, and you'll read:
                <span class="keyword">010010000100111101010100</span>. That's
                <span class="special">in binary</span>. Of course, your
                <span class="keyword">Hot Binary Heat Changing Mug</span>
                could just be paying you a compliment. Cheeky, mug.
